Website Re-Audit Findings
After implementing the improvements from improve.md, the website shows significant enhancements in SEO, performance, and accessibility. Below are the observations from the re-audit, along with a few additional recommendations for remaining issues:
Accessibility and Usability
Skip Navigation on All Pages: The homepage (index.html) correctly implements a ‚ÄúSkip to main content‚Äù link that allows keyboard and screen-reader users to bypass repetitive navigation
w3.org
. However, the skip link is missing on subpages (Courses, Success Stories, Contact). To comply with WCAG 2.4.1 (Bypass Blocks), each page should have a skip link as the first focusable element pointing to the page‚Äôs main content area
w3.org
w3.org
. Ensure an element with id="main-content" (or similar) is present on every page so the skip link has a valid target.
Mobile Menu Button Labeling: The responsive ‚Äúhamburger‚Äù menu toggle button currently has no accessible name (no visible text or aria-label). This means assistive tech would announce it just as ‚Äúbutton‚Äù with no context. To fix this, add an aria-label (e.g. aria-label="Open menu") or screen-reader-only text to describe its purpose
medium.com
medium.com
. Additionally, mark the decorative icon inside the button with aria-hidden="true" so it‚Äôs ignored by screen readers
medium.com
. This will ensure users know the button is for opening the navigation menu.
Form Accessibility: The contact form has improved accessibility with ARIA attributes. Error messages are injected with role="alert" and aria-live="polite", and fields get aria-describedby pointing to error text. This is excellent. One small consideration: if JavaScript is disabled, the form uses novalidate, so required fields might submit blank. Since you already include the required attributes in HTML, you could remove the novalidate attribute to allow basic HTML5 validation when JS is off. This would be a progressive enhancement for the rare non-JS scenario.
Focus Indicators & High Contrast: The site provides custom focus styles (e.g. a 2px solid outline on focused buttons, links, inputs) which improves keyboard visibility. The skip link is also styled to appear when focused, with a clear outline. High-contrast mode support is evident via media query ‚Äì for example, increasing the thickness of menu icon lines and adding a border in high contrast mode. These adjustments help ensure the site remains usable under various user preference settings.
Performance and Optimization
WebP Image Implementation: You indicated adding WebP support, but currently no actual .webp images are included in the project, and the HTML <img> tags don‚Äôt use the <picture> element for fallbacks. To fully realize this improvement, provide images in WebP format alongside a JPEG/PNG fallback. The recommended approach is using a <picture> tag: include a <source> pointing to the WebP image and an <img> fallback for browsers that lack WebP support
ascend-agency.medium.com
. This way modern browsers get the faster WebP, and others gracefully fallback
ascend-agency.medium.com
. (Alternatively, a script or server-side content negotiation can be used, but <picture> is simplest.)
Host All Assets Locally: The homepage currently loads company logos from an external service (Clearbit) via URLs like logo.clearbit.com (e.g. for Cisco, Amazon, etc.). While this works, it introduces external HTTP requests. It‚Äôs better to use the locally stored SVG logos (/images/logos/companies/*.svg) to reduce third-party dependencies and leverage your caching. Hosting images on your own domain can slightly improve load times by reusing existing connections
stackoverflow.com
 and avoids any external service outages or rate limits. Consider updating those <img> references to use the local files for improved reliability and performance.
Image Dimensions to Prevent CLS: Many <img> tags (such as the partner logos and other images) do not have explicit width/height attributes. Modern best practice is to include the intrinsic width and height (or use CSS aspect-ratio) so the browser can allocate space before the image loads

. This prevents content from jumping when images load, improving the Cumulative Layout Shift metric. Given your layout is responsive, you can set width/height to the image‚Äôs natural dimensions ‚Äì the browser will preserve the aspect ratio as it scales the image. This simple addition avoids layout jank and makes pages feel more stable as they load

.
Additional Observations: All other performance optimizations appear well-implemented. The lazy-loading script with Intersection Observer is working to defer offscreen images. CSS contain is used on certain elements (like .hero and the mobile menu) to limit layout scope, which is great for complex pages. The site also preloads critical CSS/JS (e.g. mobile-styles.css) and uses font-display: swap for text‚Äîensuring content is quickly visible. These techniques align with Core Web Vitals goals and should help keep First Contentful Paint and other metrics in good shape.
Progressive Web App (PWA) & Other Technical Notes
PWA Manifest Icons: The site.webmanifest is present and includes basic metadata. One thing to address is the icons array ‚Äì currently only a 32√ó32 favicon is listed. For a PWA, browsers expect at least a 192√ó192 and a 512√ó512 PNG icon for app installability
web.dev
. It‚Äôs recommended to add these so that if users add the site to their home screen, the icon looks crisp. You can still include the favicon, but adding larger icons (and perhaps setting "purpose": "any maskable" for adaptive icons) will satisfy PWA requirements
web.dev
.
Service Worker & Offline: The service worker is implemented with multiple caching strategies (network-first for dynamic pages, cache-first for images, stale-while-revalidate for assets, etc.), which is excellent. It even includes a user-friendly update notification ‚Äì on detecting a new version, it shows a ‚ÄúNew content available ‚Äì Refresh‚Äù prompt. This ensures users get updates without confusion. Be sure to test the update flow to confirm the notification appears as expected. Also, note that the SW is currently skipping waiting and immediately activating on update (which is fine given the notification prompt).
Code Hygiene: The codebase is well-structured and commented. A minor point: you may want to remove or disable console.log statements (e.g. SW registration success/failure logs) in production to avoid cluttering the console for users. It‚Äôs not a critical issue, but a clean console can be seen as a mark of polish. Additionally, ensure no sensitive files are deployed ‚Äì the .git folder was included in the zip, but on the live server you‚Äôll want to exclude that (your .htaccess already blocks access to .git* files, which is good).
Conclusion
Overall, no major issues were found after the fixes ‚Äì the site is much improved in SEO metadata, loading performance, and accessibility. üéâ The recommendations above are mostly small tweaks to capture edge cases or further optimizations. If those are addressed, the website will adhere even more closely to best practices (and potentially score even higher on Lighthouse/PWA audits). Since no critical problems remain, no substantial changes are needed. The site is ready to go live, and you can proceed with confidence. Keep monitoring your analytics and user feedback, and consider running it through Lighthouse/PageSpeed Insights for quantifiable metric improvements (as a next step, as you already plan)

. Great work on implementing the improvements ‚Äì it clearly made a positive difference!
